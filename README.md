# EECS Tools  

A collection of handy functions for introductory ECE/EECS courses. These functions are designed to assist students to quickly calculate what they want during exams. To maximize simplicity, every function is independent from one another. 

## Usage  

To-do: add notebook integration and tutorial

## Coverage  
  
Functions are organized in directories, with their respective coverage shown below:  
- `SteadyDC`: Steady-state DC circuits 
- `SteadyAC`: Steady-state AC circuits 
- `Dynamic`: RC/RL/RLC circuits 
- `Digital`: Logic operations and digital circuits 
- `Util`: Utility functions, mostly math-related
